message  Cryptocat A very short introduction Keys and Fingerprints: This is Important What  Cryptocat Doesn’t Do While  Cryptocat aims to 
offer strongly en Crypted,  private Instant Messaging,  it’s important to note what  Cryptocat does not protect you against:  Cryptocat does 
not anonymize you: While your communications are en Crypted,  your identity can still be traced since  Cryptocat does not mask your IP 
address. For anonymization,  we highly recommend using Tor.  Cryptocat does not protect against key loggers: Your messages are en Crypted 
as they go through the wire,  but that doesn’t mean that your keyboard is necessarily safe.  Cryptocat does not protect against hardware 
or software key loggers which might be snooping on your keyboard strokes and sending them to an undesired third party.  Cryptocat does 
not protect against untrustworthy people: Parties you’re conversing with may still leak your messages without your knowledge.  Cryptocat 
aims to make sure that only the parties you’re talking to get your messages,  but that doesn’t mean these parties are necessarily 
trustworthy.
